This project uses historical Indian state budget data to forecast Non-Plan Budget trends using Linear Regression in Python. 
The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning model training, and future prediction from 2011 to 2030.

# Dataset Overview

- **File**: `Budget.xlsx`
- **Fields Used**:
  - `TimePeriod` – Year (2001 to 2010)
  - `Area_Name` – State/UT names
  - `Indicator_Name` – Focused on “Non-Plan Budget”
  - `Data_Value` – Budget amount (in INR)

---

# Objectives

- Clean and structure raw government budget data
- Analyze budget growth trends over years
- Apply **Linear Regression** to forecast future budgets
- Visualize actual vs. predicted vs. future data

# Technologies Used

| Tool          | Purpose                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Python        | Programming language        |

# Steps Performed

 1. Data Cleaning
- Filtered only relevant entries (`Indicator_Name = 'Non-Plan Budget'`)
- Converted `Data_Value` to numeric
- Removed missing/null values

 2. Trend Analysis
- Grouped average budget by `TimePeriod`
- Plotted budget growth over time

 3. Model Training
- Defined features: `X = TimePeriod`, target: `y = Data_Value`
- Performed train-test split
- Trained Linear Regression model using `sklearn`

 4. Evaluation
- Evaluated model using:
  - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
  - **R² Score (Accuracy)**

 5. Forecasting
- Created future years (2011–2030)
- Predicted budgets for those years
- Plotted actual, predicted, and future forecasts

# Results & Insights

- The model showed a good fit with a rising budget trend
- Future budget estimates suggest a continued increase
- Such analysis supports **data-driven governance** and **financial planning**
